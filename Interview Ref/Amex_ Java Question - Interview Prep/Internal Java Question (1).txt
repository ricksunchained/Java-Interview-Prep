Problem Solving (programm)
1. print even numbers upto 20 by using for loop/ Java 8 (i explain by using lambda)

 


=============================answer==============================================

 From integer array, find the maximum sum of 3 consecutive numbers like 

Ans : class ConsecutiveNumberSum {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int s [] = {11,21,3,4,2,100,110};
int sum = 0;
for(int i =0; i<=s.length-3; i++){
int currentSum = s[i] + s[i+1]+ s[i+2];
if(sum < currentSum){
sum = currentSum;
}
}
System.out.println("Highest Sum :" +sum);
}
}

2. How will you create REST API for above code?
Ans : In RestController, I will add @Postmapping("/max-sum")
Then, call service layer and there do above calculation and return result to controller.
From controller, given response to client.

3. AMEX is working on Java 11 so please share new feature in Java 11

3. Explain packaging and deployment
Ans : From spring boot project we can use gradle for packaging and will get jar file for deployment.

4. Explain about security to REST API.
Ans : Following Role based Security, First authentication will be done and then will get token in response. 
Using that token we can identify role and then it's access rights.

5. How will you optimize of application vertically?
Ans : Add multiple App server so that multiple requests can be serviced well. We can keep minimum count of App servers 
as per out load and scale it up as per requirement whenever needed. e.g. Suppose there is sudden increase in no. of request and we have less app servers and those are fully occupied
and out load balancer can not send more request to existing app servers then on demand we can spin up more app servers as per need and once need is fulfilled and request are less 
then we can turn them down.

6. How to mitigate attacks?
Ans : If there are invalid request are coming in then one layer of our application will filter it out and we can accept only valid request by recognizing the expected pattern.
	  And also we can block that source from where requests are coming in.

7. How to create One To Many Relationship?

8. Explain unit test cases and how will you write it?
Ans : Explain different test cases for above code. Explain about Junit and mockito framework.

9. In spring boot how to ensure test are invoked?
Ans : Mention test repository in gradle/pom file.

10. How to support transactions?
Ans : Using @Transactional will be  helpful to handle transactions. Also need to mention datasource alsong with it as different db support transactions different way.

11. How to debug production issues?
Ans : By looking at the logs or by checking the behaviour of the requests made by particular user.

12. What is tracing?
Ans : Tracing is tracking a particular transaction/request from a user. At start of application we can given an id to request and then we can track that particular transaction.

13. What is OutOfMemory Error?
Ans : This error is thrown when there is insufficient space to allocate an object in the Java heap.

14. Check if a pair exists with given
Given an array A[] of n numbers and another number x, the task is to check whether or not there exist two elements in A[] whose sum is exactly x.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}, x= -2
Output: Yes
Explanation:  If we calculate the sum of the output,1 + (-3) = -2

Input: arr[] = {1, -2, 1, 0, 5}, x = 0
Output: No
public class Tst1 {

==========================solution=================================================

   public static boolean m1(int[] A,int size, int y){
        for(int i=0; i<(size-1);i++){
            for(int j=(i+1); j<size;j++){
                if(A[i]+A[j]==y){
                    return true;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int[] A={1, -2, 1, 0, 5};
        int y =0;
        int size = A.length;
        if(m1(A,size,y)){
            System.out.println("yes");
